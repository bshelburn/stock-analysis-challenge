#Stock Analysis Challenge
---
## Overview
Performed an analysis for Steve and his parents looking at stock performance data provided for both 2017 and 2018. Included are the screenshots of run times for both the original code and the refactored code.   This project is an expansion of a spreadsheet and code provided to Steve and his parents during module work which originally focused on stock ticker DQ and then expanded to all stock performance in the data set over a two year time period.

### Purpose
This analysis was the result of Steve's parents wanting to analyze stock performance (12 stocks provided) over the years of 2017 and 2018 to determine the best potential investments.

## Results
### Analysis of Stocks
___
### 2017 Original

### 2017 Refactored

Overall stocks performed very well for the year of 2017.   tHE ONLY STOCK WITH A NEGAtive return was TERP out of the 12 analyzied.   Although Steve's parents were looking at Daily Volume traded as an indicator of a successful stock TERP was actually 5 out of 12 in terms of volume but still had a negative return.

### 2018 Original

### 2018 Refactored

2018 was a much different year in terms of the stocks being analyzed.   Only two (ENPH & RUN) showed a positive return with all others showing negative. The two stocks showing a positive return were in the top 3 for 2018 when looking at daily volume traded.

## Summary
My reccomendation for Steve's parents would be to take a closer look at both ENPH and RUN for investments.   It would be wise to do a similar analysis for 2019 and 2020 data.

The advantage of refactoring code is that you can reapply an existing solution to more quickly accomplish your objective once modified for your specific data set.   Disadvanteges include not knowing exactly how the writer of the code was going about solving their problem.   Utilizing the whitespace (notes) is key to being able to explain your thought process to others and to also remind yourself of how the issue was being approached should you need to step away.

I had mixed results in terms of how efficient the code ran with the "2017 Original" taking the least amount of time to run although the other 3 were very close.  This could be due to other programs running the the background when the screenshot was taken and memory being used.   If there was a larger data set this could pose an issue however the difference between both is just fractions of a sentence and not noticable by the user.
